# NeXT_SOC
This project is an implementation of NeXT HW on an FPGA.

Notes
-
* Every component of this project must be open source (obviously roms are an exception to this)
* This SOC will implement a NeXTstation Color (4096 colors).
* There is no need for the NeXTdimension board at this point as we will not, initially have the NeXTBus interface
* This SOC should be a drop in replacement for black hardware.
